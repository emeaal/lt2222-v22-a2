Part 1 - Explain how you implemented the random selection

I used the choices function from the random module for implementing the random selection of lines (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices). I used it without weights so that it will be totally random and no biased towards some sentences. "k" represents the size that is returned and in this case it is 100000 lines.
